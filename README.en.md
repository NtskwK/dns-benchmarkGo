# dnspy - A Testing Tool for Locally Testing the Accessibility and Performance of DNS Servers Worldwide

[English](./README.en.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡](./README.md)

Frustrated with domestic DNS being hijacked by operators, needing reliable services to support normal internet access.

There aren't many existing tools, and dnsjumper has issues like only supporting Windows, fewer data sources, and fewer evaluation dimensions.

So I made a tool to test the servers that can be used normally on the local network and their performance, written in Golang supporting Windows, macOS, Linux.

It also comes with a visualization analysis website that lets you see at a glance which DNS servers you can use ðŸ˜Š, friendly reminder: click on the bar chart in the data analysis panel to copy the server address.

Usage: Follow the instructions below to download the testing tool, get the test result json file, open the analysis panel website, upload the data for analysis. The website does not store data.

## Usage

![dnspy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a499d2fc-ffcd-4b71-a0dd-d6e5839792dd)

Download the `dns-benchmarkGo-*` file according to your system architecture from the [releases](https://github.com/NtskwK/dns-benchmarkGo/releases) page in this repository. For example, for macOS with M series processors, download the `dnspy-darwin-arm64` file.

Then **you must disable all proxy software's Tun mode and virtual network card mode, otherwise it will affect the test results.**
Then **you must disable all proxy software's Tun mode and virtual network card mode, otherwise it will affect the test results.**
Then **you must disable all proxy software's Tun mode and virtual network card mode, otherwise it will affect the test results.**

Rename the file to `dnspy` (Windows is `dnspy.exe`), then open a terminal, navigate to the directory where this file is located. Execute the command to start testing

```bash
unset http_proxy https_proxy all_proxy HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY ALL_PROXY
./dnspy
```

Follow the prompts to start the test.

By default, multi-threading mode is used to speed up testing. However, the default parameter of 10 threads requires at least 1 MB/s upstream and downstream network and at least 4-core processor.
If the network or processor is not good, it will lead to inaccurate test results, you must reduce the number of threads through the `-w` parameter.

After the test is completed, it will be output to a JSON file in the current directory with a name like `dnspy_result_2024-11-07-17-32-13.json`.

Enter `Y` or `y` or just press Enter as prompted by the program, and the data analysis dashboard website will automatically open. Click the `Read Analysis` button in the top right corner of the website, select your JSON file, and you can see the visualized test results.

### Running in Source Code Mode

#### 1. Clone repository and initialize submodules

  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NtskwK/dns-benchmarkGo.git
  cd dns-benchmark/src
  ```

  If you have already cloned the repository, use the following command to initialize submodules:

  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

#### 2. Run

  ```bash
  go run .
  ```

## Available Parameters

```batch
~> dnspy-windows-amd64.exe -h  

Usage examples:

dnspy

Start testing directly using built-in worldwide domains

dnspy -s 114.114.114.114

Test a single server

dnspy dnspy_benchmark_2024-10-22-08-18.json

Visualize analysis of test results

Parameter description:
  -c, --concurrency int   Number of concurrent tests per test
                           (default 10)
  -d, --domains string    File path to store domain data for batch testing
                          Must be a file path relative to the current program working directory
                          Internal file format is one per line
                          If not modified, use the built-in 10000 popular domains
                           (default "@sampleDomains@")
  -t, --duration int      Duration of each test, in seconds

  -f, --file string       File path to store server data for batch testing

                          This parameter uses the old method to output a single HTML file to the same directory as the data json

## Compilation

Required environment for compilation:

- You need `Go` environment and `curl` command on your computer, preferably `make` command, otherwise you may need to manually execute the contents of the makefile
